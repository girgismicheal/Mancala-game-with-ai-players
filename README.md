# Project Brief Description:

Full implementation of the famous Mancala Game from scratch.<br><br>
**Including 4 Modes of the game:**
1. Human player Vs. Human player
2. Human player Vs. Ai player
3. Ai player Vs. Human player
4. Ai player Vs. Ai player


**Project Features:**
1. The Ai player uses MinMax Algorithm With Alpha-beta
Pruning written from scratch.
2. The project supports the “Stealing Mode“ of Mancala
3. Various difficulties of AI player (Easy, Medium, and Hard).
4. Saving and loading the current game in case of any sudden termination during the game.
5. Various checks on users' input before the game or within the game.
6. Alpha beta optimization.
7. Added timer inside the mini-max algorithm.
8. Added iterative deepening variant of minmax algorithm.
9. MinMax optimization using sorting of children.
